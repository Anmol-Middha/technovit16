							<p style="text-align:center;">As cities dive into virtuality, it wouldn’t be fair unless we had our share of it, thus presenting, Virtual Reality.</p>
							<p>Virtual Reality alongside Augmented Reality is taking the world by storm. This event introduces students to the world of VR technology using the Google Cardboard. Select your choice of excitement or terror among a choice of the best applications available. Have a fright in our virtual haunted houses, or speed down our mining tunnel in pixelated train cars, or scavenge your way through a thick wild jungle, the king cats breathing down the back of your neck. Step up and experience mind-boggling 360 degree virtual reality for a thriller experience.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center;">“My mind rebels at stagnation, give me problems, give me work!”</p>
							<p>Get ready, put on your hats, and for heaven’s sake, Watson, get over here! Sherlock Ohms is no ordinary game… in fact “it’s quite a three pipe problem”. This event is designed to test your quick-thinking, observation, as well as technical skills. Play a Sherlock Holmes starring in an electrical world, and solve riddles and crimes to win."The question is not if, but how. The Game is afoot.”</p>
							<p style="text-align:center;">RULES AND ABOUT THE GAME</p>
							<p>As Holmes and Watson, your duet team shall endure 4 rounds, two hours for two days.<br>
							<br>
							Day 1 comprises of 2 rounds. The first sees each group given a set of brain twisters to be solved in the given time, succeeding which, you proceed to round 2. In the second round, a stimulating treasure hunt for ‘data’ (components) is held, before the strike of the clock. Failure to do so will result in elimination.<br>
							<br>
							Day 2 begins with round 3, and your eye through a magnifying glass. Yes, this round shows Holmes and Watson working a real time case, interrogating witnesses, and observing clues, from which they must solve the case. To take a leaf out of the detective’s book, “The little details are by far the most important”. In the fourth and final round, the detectives are given fake currency, to ‘buy’ the components, according to the given list (price and points of components mentioned), from volunteers located around the campus. In case more than one detective requests to buy the component, an auction will be started. Be wary, the team with most points and highest savings of money will be declared the winner. To all those investigators out there, “come at once if convenient. If inconvenient, come all the same”.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center;">As we move forward towards new technology and inventions, and with the idea of smart city driving us to a better tomorrow, there is a need to learn a smart way to design our circuits to meet their needs.</p>
							<p>For those aspiring for circuit designing, but have no clue where to start, Mathetronics is your place to be. A great way to stay “connected’, it is a two day tutorial class workshop, the first day being about the basics of circuit design, and the second an on-screening and team selection (based on a 3 round competition).
							</p>
							<p>Teams of two will go through a three questionnaire rounds, the first two being 10 questions in 30 minutes. The last round will have 10 questions for a time period of 60 minutes. Selection of the team will be based on successfully solving of the problem in the shortest time period. Periodic eliminations will take place between the rounds, sending only half its competitors onwards, and 4 teams for the final round.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify;">With our cities becoming “smarter”, we are compelled to keep up, now more than ever. Life after university for engineers everywhere depends on those crucial few days of campus placements and job interviews. Last Man Standing aims to put the “smart” in you.</p>
							<p>This involving event is all about getting you ready for your placements. What better way to do that than to simulate the whole process starting with a technical round, consisting of a pen and paper test, focusing on both quantitative and verbal reasoning. Followed, will be a ‘Group discussion’ where in batches of eight, the candidates will brainstorm and present their points and opinions on various ingenious topics. The final round is the real deal, a mock interview conducted by a HR from a reputable firm. The last man standing, who finally lands the job will be declared the winner.</p>
							<p>We look forward to testing your communication and leadership skills, your ability to work in a team, and, of course technical, interpersonal and problem solving skills as well. Your enthusiastic participation in this event will definitely give you a good chance at nailing your real placements! So get started, get formal and sell your amazing personality at this event!</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify;">Do YOU have the world’s most DEADLY robot? Are YOU ready to CRUSH YOUR OPPONENT? Are you READY TO WIN, FIGHT till the end, fight till DEATH? If that’s so, YOU are in the right place. Welcome to connectiVITieee’16‘s very own DEATH RACE! Brace yourselves to experience the ultimate battle of blades, chainsaws, lasers, and mighty pushes, a war of brains and brawn, and robot possessed devils themselves. This time, we’re taking the Death Race to a whole new level! Don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p>
							<p><strong>ON THE BATTLEGROUND</strong><br>	
							The Death Race comprises of two levels of competition. The first, themed as ‘Fast &amp; Furious, is a RoboRace. The bot must overcome the various hurdles within the time-limit and reach the final checkpoint. Teams may choose to skip a hurdle at the cost of obtaining a penalty. The second, is themed as RoboWar. Every team’s robot must bear a minimum of one weapon. Explosive weapons are not allowed. This is a point-based level. The winner will be decided based on scores from both the levels.</p>
							<p><strong>SCORE STRUCTURE</strong><br>
							Level 1: <br> Fast &amp; Furious: The maximum Time limit to complete the track is 3 mins. The scoring will be done in the following way: (3*60 seconds – Time taken by the Robot to complete the track (in sec)). (Weapons are not allowed in this level.) <br>
							Level 2: <br> The RoboWar: Two teams will compete in the pit for 1.5 minutes. 10 points will be awarded when one robot hits the other. If a team disables the robot of the other then 20 bonus points will be awarded. If a team pushes another robot out of the pit then 20 points will be awarded. <br>
							Grand Finale: <br> Best teams (combined success in all the above levels) will compete in the real Death Race. Two teams will race together and points will be awarded for damaging the other bot while racing. The bots will then cross the war pit where they will have to fight for 1.5 minutes, and then continue the race. The team surpassing all the levels will thus be named the victor of the Death Race.</p>
							<p><strong>RULES AND REGULATIONS</strong><br>
